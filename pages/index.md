## About

Data on this app complements [Bless your chart](https://blessyourchart.substack.com/), a free weekly data visualization publication about college sports from [Chris Gallo](https://hellogallo.com/).

Bless your heart is a one of the more versatile phrases in Southern lexicon. It can mean so many different things. Good, bad, and ugly. Itâ€™s all in the tone and context of how you use it.

Bless your chart is a bad pun.

As you visualize data, the same thing can apply. One person might draw completely different conclusions than another person. So as you read this publication, you might say . . . _bless your ~~heart~~ chart_.
