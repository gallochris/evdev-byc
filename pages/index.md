## About

Data on this app complements [Bless your chart](https://blessyourchart.substack.com/), a free weekly data visualization publication about college sports from [Chris Gallo](https://hellogallo.com/). 

Bless your heart is a one of the more versatile phrases in Southern lexicon. It can mean so many different things. Good, bad, and ugly. Itâ€™s all in the tone and context of how you use it.

Bless your chart is a bad pun.

As you visualize data, the same thing can apply. One person might draw completely different conclusions than another person. So as you read this publication, you might say . . . _bless your ~~heart~~ chart_.

### What can you find here? 

The current focus is the 2024 college football season. 

Data includes: 
- team ratings from FPI and F+ 
- conference standings and point differentials 
- point spreads and totals 

As of November 22, I'm starting to add 2024-25 college basketball data. This includes:
- non-conference results 
- head-to-head conference records
