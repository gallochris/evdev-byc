## About

Data on this app complements [Bless your chart](https://blessyourchart.substack.com/), a free data visualization publication about college sports from [Chris Gallo](https://hellogallo.com/).

Bless your heart is a one of the more versatile phrases in Southern lexicon. It can mean so many different things. Good, bad, and ugly. Itâ€™s all in the tone and context of how you use it.

Bless your chart is a bad pun.

As you visualize data, the same thing can apply. One person might draw completely different conclusions than another person. So as you read this publication, you might say . . . _bless your ~~heart~~ chart_.

### What can you find here?

The current focus is shifting to the 2025 college football season. So far, the schedule is surfaced and plan to add more data soon.  

You can view data around the 2024-25 college basketball season too. This includes head-to-head conference results, a gamelog of all DI games, and a log of WAB (wins-above-baseline) for individual games.
